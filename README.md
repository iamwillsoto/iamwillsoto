# Will Soto — AWS Cloud Engineer

AWS Cloud Engineer building and operating secure, scalable cloud infrastructure in production environments.

I design AWS platforms centered on automation, access control, and operational reliability. My work focuses on infrastructure clarity, resilient network design, and systems built to perform under real operational demand.

This profile reflects hands-on implementation and architectural ownership.

## Engineering Approach

I build AWS platforms that are:

- Highly available by design (multi-AZ, autoscaling, load balancing)
- Secure through structured IAM and role-based access control
- Network-segmented across public and private tiers
- Automated with Terraform-managed infrastructure
- Observable through metrics, logging, and alerting
- Built for maintainability and operational consistency
