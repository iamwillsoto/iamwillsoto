# Will Soto — Cloud DevOps Engineer ☁️

Cloud DevOps Engineer focused on building **production-grade AWS infrastructure**, event-driven systems, and CI/CD pipelines that mirror real-world operating environments.  
My work emphasizes **environment isolation (beta → prod)**, **Infrastructure as Code**, and **secure, observable cloud platforms**.

---

## What I Do

- Design and deploy **AWS-native architectures** using Terraform
- Build **event-driven pipelines** with Lambda, S3, and Step Functions
- Implement **CI/CD promotion workflows** (PR → Beta, Merge → Prod)
- Apply **least-privilege IAM** and security-first design
- Operate systems with **logging, retries, and failure awareness**

This GitHub contains hands-on implementations — not toy examples — with documentation and architectural context for each project.
