# Will Soto — Cloud Engineer (AWS)

Cloud Engineer building reliable, production-ready AWS infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD. My work focuses on event-driven architectures, environment isolation (beta → prod), and secure automation that reflects real platform team workflows.

I design systems to be reproducible, observable, and operationally sound.

## About

I work primarily in AWS, designing and operating cloud platforms using Terraform, serverless services, containers, and CI/CD pipelines that enforce safe change management. My projects emphasize architectural clarity, least-privilege security, and operational reliability over one-off demos.

This GitHub serves as a hands-on portfolio of production-style Cloud and DevOps implementations, each supported by documentation and architectural context.
