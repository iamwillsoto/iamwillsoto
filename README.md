# Will Soto — Cloud DevOps Engineer

Cloud DevOps Engineer building reliable, production-ready cloud platforms using Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD.  
My work emphasizes operational consistency, security-first design, and automation aligned with real platform and operations workflows.

I develop processes that are consistent, repeatable, and automated.

## About

I design and operate cloud platforms using Terraform, serverless services, containers, and CI/CD pipelines that enforce safe change management and least-privilege security.

My engineering approach is cloud-agnostic, grounded in platform fundamentals such as identity-first access, network isolation, automated provisioning, and operational observability. These principles are applied consistently across AWS and Azure environments.

This GitHub serves as a hands-on portfolio of production-style Cloud and DevOps implementations, supported by technical documentation and architectural context.
