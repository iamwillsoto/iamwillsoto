# Will Soto — Cloud DevOps Engineer (AWS)

Cloud DevOps Engineer focused on designing, automating, and operating reliable AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD. My work centers on event-driven architectures, environment isolation, and production-ready automation that reflects how real platform teams operate.

I build systems to be reproducible, observable, and secure — with clear promotion paths from development to production.

## About

I work primarily in AWS, designing and deploying cloud infrastructure with Terraform, serverless services, and CI/CD pipelines that enforce safe change management. My projects emphasize architectural clarity, least-privilege security, and operational reliability rather than one-off demos.

This GitHub serves as a hands-on portfolio of production-style Cloud and DevOps implementations, each supported by documentation and architectural context.
