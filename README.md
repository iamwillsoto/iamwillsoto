# Will Soto — AWS Cloud Engineer

AWS Cloud Engineer architecting and operating secure, resilient, production-scale cloud infrastructure.

I design AWS environments where availability, security, automation, and operational clarity are foundational — not afterthoughts. My work focuses on infrastructure lifecycle governance, identity-driven access control, scalable network architecture, and systems built to withstand real operational demand. 

This profile represents hands-on implementation and architectural ownership.

## Engineering Approach

I build AWS platforms that are:

- Highly available by design (multi-AZ architecture, autoscaling, managed failover)
- Secure through structured IAM policy design and permission boundaries
- Network-segmented with deliberate public/private isolation
- Fully automated via Terraform-based infrastructure lifecycle management
- Observable with metrics, structured logs, and actionable alarms
- Designed for maintainability, auditability, and long-term stability

My engineering standard prioritizes durability, security posture, and operational maturity.
